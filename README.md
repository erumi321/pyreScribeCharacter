# pyreScribeCharacter
Requires MgicGonads mod importer for SGG. Adds 9 scribes to the game Pyre that are the base 9 classes but with highly buffed stats yet their hope is 0.
# Installation
Install this nay other way you would install a SGG mod with the mod importer. Next go to .../Content/Scripts/DraftScripts.lua. Comment out line 1856,1858, 1866, 1885, 1887, and 1895. Save, run the game and enjoy your new 9 scribes.

# Optional
I would also reccomend commenting out lines 7206 and 7212 in .../Content/Scripts/LeagueGenerationScripts.lua as this will remove a clamp on presence and quickness values.
